# R_SocialBakers_API
R code was used to connect TIBCO Spotfire to Social Bakers API.

For this project, i have been using RStudio to develop those connectors.
They are optimized to work with TIBCO Statistics Service parsing to an Open R engine.

I did not test with TERR but may work, sometimes need some fix on the code to work properly.

# Careful
Do not use the "rascunhos" branch.
They are only test code to improve the data structure.
